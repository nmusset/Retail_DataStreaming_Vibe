# Persona - Product Owner

## Description

As a product owner, I serve as the bridge between clients and the development teams (both functional and platform). I translate client business needs into requirements for functional developers, ensuring the platform capabilities meet market demands. I'm responsible for delivery timelines, solution quality, and overall client satisfaction while maintaining platform sustainability.

## Needs

- **Client requirements clarity**: Clear understanding of what clients need from the solution
- **Platform capabilities overview**: Knowledge of what the platform can and cannot do
- **Progress visibility**: Real-time insights into development and deployment status
- **Quality metrics**: Data on solution reliability, performance, and client satisfaction
- **Resource planning tools**: Ability to estimate effort and timelines for new clients
- **Risk assessment**: Early warning of potential issues or blockers
- **Communication channels**: Effective ways to coordinate between clients and teams
- **SLA tracking**: Monitoring of service level agreements and compliance

## Wishes

- **Fast time-to-market**: Quick onboarding of new clients with reliable solutions
- **Predictable delivery**: Consistent ability to commit to and meet deadlines
- **Platform reliability**: Confidence that the solution will work as promised
- **Comprehensive observability**: Dashboard showing health of all client workflows
- **Flexible solutions**: Platform adaptability to diverse client requirements
- **Client self-service**: Clients able to monitor their data flows without my involvement
- **Proactive issue detection**: Problems identified and resolved before clients notice
- **Scalability confidence**: Assurance the platform can handle growth

## Fears & Blockers

- **Unmet client expectations**: Delivering solutions that don't match client needs
- **Platform limitations**: Discovering the platform can't support a client requirement
- **Quality issues**: Transformations producing incorrect data affecting client trust
- **Communication breakdowns**: Misalignment between what clients request and what gets built
- **Unexpected delays**: Platform or functional team issues pushing back delivery timelines
- **Scope creep**: Client requirements expanding without corresponding resource adjustment
- **Support burden**: Excessive time spent troubleshooting instead of delivering new value
- **Competitive disadvantage**: Platform constraints making solutions less attractive than alternatives
- **Hidden technical debt**: Shortcuts taken today creating problems for future clients
- **Multi-client conflicts**: Platform changes for one client negatively affecting others
