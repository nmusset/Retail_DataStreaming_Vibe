# Persona - Client

## Description

As a client, I consume data transformed by the platform to support my business operations. I represent various independent organizations or business units that need reliable data delivery without concerning myself with the underlying technical complexity. I expect a turnkey solution that delivers clean, accurate data when I need it.

## Needs

- **Reliable data delivery**: I need to receive transformed data consistently and on time
- **Data accuracy**: The data I receive must be correct and meet the agreed specifications
- **Simple onboarding**: I want a straightforward process to start receiving data
- **Clear communication**: I need to understand what data I'll receive and when, in business terms
- **Minimal maintenance**: The system should work without requiring ongoing effort from my side
- **Support availability**: When issues arise, I need responsive support to resolve them quickly

## Wishes

- **"It just works"**: I want to focus on using the data, not managing the delivery system
- **Predictable performance**: Consistent data delivery times and formats
- **Transparent status**: Simple notifications when data is delivered or if there are issues
- **Easy configuration changes**: If my data needs evolve, I want changes to be simple to request and implement
- **No technical knowledge required**: I shouldn't need to understand databases, scripts, or transformations
- **Isolated operations**: My data flow should be independent of other clients' operations

## Fears & Blockers

- **System downtime**: Missing critical data deliveries due to platform failures
- **Data quality issues**: Receiving incorrect or corrupted data that affects my business decisions
- **Complex technical requirements**: Being forced to understand or manage technical aspects
- **Dependency on others**: My data delivery being affected by issues with other clients
- **Slow issue resolution**: Problems taking too long to diagnose and fix
- **Hidden costs**: Unexpected charges or effort required to maintain the service
- **Vendor lock-in**: Difficulty switching providers or changing my integration if needed
