# Persona - Developer (platform team)

## Description

As a developer from the platform team, I build and maintain the core infrastructure that orchestrates data querying, transformation execution, and delivery to clients. My responsibility is to ensure the platform is reliable, scalable, and maintainable while providing a stable interface for functional developers and seamless service for clients.

## Needs

- **Clear architecture**: Well-defined system boundaries and component responsibilities
- **Comprehensive testing**: Automated tests that catch regressions before deployment
- **Monitoring and alerting**: Real-time visibility into system health and performance
- **Deployment automation**: CI/CD pipelines for safe, repeatable deployments
- **Documentation**: Technical documentation for architecture, APIs, and operational procedures
- **Backward compatibility tools**: Mechanisms to support existing integrations during updates
- **Incident response tools**: Debugging and diagnostic capabilities for production issues
- **Performance metrics**: Detailed insights into system resource usage and bottlenecks

## Wishes

- **Modular architecture**: Components that can be updated independently
- **Zero-downtime deployments**: Release new versions without interrupting client services
- **Automated rollback**: Quick recovery mechanisms if deployments cause issues
- **Predictable performance**: Consistent system behavior under various loads
- **Technical debt management**: Time and processes to refactor and improve code quality
- **Innovation capacity**: Ability to introduce new features without disrupting existing functionality
- **Clear deprecation paths**: Structured approach to sunset old features or APIs
- **Cross-team collaboration**: Smooth communication with functional developers

## Fears & Blockers

- **Breaking existing workflows**: Updates that inadvertently break client integrations
- **Cascading failures**: A single issue affecting multiple clients or transformations
- **Technical debt accumulation**: Quick fixes creating long-term maintenance problems
- **Unclear requirements**: Ambiguous needs from stakeholders leading to wrong implementations
- **Resource constraints**: Insufficient time or infrastructure to implement changes properly
- **Monitoring blind spots**: Production issues that go undetected until clients complain
- **Complex dependencies**: Tightly coupled components making changes risky
- **Rollback difficulties**: Inability to quickly revert problematic deployments
- **Knowledge silos**: Critical system knowledge concentrated in few team members
